Simple iframe 8.x - 1.x
==============================

This module provides a new field type for displaying iframes.
The field provides the most basic settings for an iframe display: src,width and height.
Rendering is done using twig. So it's easy to override to fit your needs.

By default the module allows you to set a default value for the width (default 100% for responsiveness) and height.
The defaults can be overridden in the field settings.
