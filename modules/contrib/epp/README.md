# Entity Prepopulate

## Introduction

Entity Prepopulate prepopulates any entity field with values containing tokens.

- Works on the entity, not form level, which is more robust
- All prepopulation is explicit, which is good for security
- Works with multi-property fields (think geofield) out of the box

Built as successor of [Prepopulate](https://www.drupal.org/project/prepopulate) module, this module only works for entity forms though. For non-entity forms, we recommend using Prepopulate.
