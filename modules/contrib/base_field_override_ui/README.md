INTRODUCTION
------------

The Base Field Override UI module enables an interface to be able to change the
labels and descriptions of the fields that have been created by code using the
BaseFieldDefinition class (Example, the title field of the node entity).

Currently you have the possibility to change the title label in each content
type, but this is not the case with the rest of the fields and in the other
entity types, for example taxonomy, block, or custom entities type.
