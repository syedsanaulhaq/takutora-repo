Module Builder Devel
====================

This module provides tools for developing Module Builder and Drupal Code
Builder.

- The normal code analysis form has its form class replaced with one that shows
  the time taken.
- An extra devel code analysis tab allows single code analysis tasks to be
  run and the result inspected, without saving the data.
- An extra code analysis tab updates the test sample data in Drupal Code
  Builder.
