## 1. Introduction

This module provides a core modeller, which is built solely on top of Drupal
core and ECA core.

## 2. Requirements

This module does not require anything outside of Drupal core and ECA.
* ECA: https://www.drupal.org/project/eca

## 3. Installation

Install the module as you would normally install a contributed
Drupal module. Visit https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further
information.

## 4. Usage

After installation, you can then create Core models via
`/admin/config/workflow/eca/add/core`.

## 5. Complementary modules

When the Select2 (https://www.drupal.org/project/select2) module is installed,
the user interface uses that widget to improve selection on the vast number of
available event, condition and action plugins.

When working with Tokens, the contrib Token module
(https://www.drupal.org/project/token) is recommended to be installed.
That module provides a Token browser for a convenient way to browse through
available Tokens.
