INTRODUCTION
-------------
The Custom View Filters creates two new filters for views filtering:

 * Custom Az Filter
 
 * Node granular date filter

INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
   https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
   for further information.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

On any view, you can add the following filters:

* Custom Az Filter: You can filter by the first letter of first/second word for
a given text field you will have to define. You should provide a machine field
name (special "title" field is also supported). It can be both an exposed or
admin filter. Use {{ form.custom_view_filters }} to print it directly on a twig
template.

* Node granular date filter: You can filter by year or/and month given a date
field. You should provide a machine field name (special "created" and "changed"
properties are also supported). It can be both an exposed or admin filter. Use
{{ form.nodes_granular_dates }} to print it directly on a twig template.
